The Sense Map files simply list each 2.1 noun sense (encoded as a
sense key) paired with its mapping to one or more 3.0 noun senses.
This package does not include WordNet 2.1 or 3.0.  You must download
the database package separately.  The documentation provided describes
the format of the Sense Map files.  Additional manual pages that you
might need are found in the WordNet 3.0 database package.

3. Information about WordNet
