DESCRIPTION
     The WordNet system	consists of lexicographer files, code  to
     convert these files into a	database, and search routines and
     interfaces	that display information from the database.   The
     lexicographer  files  organize nouns, verbs, adjectives, and
     adverbs into groups  of  synonyms,	 and  describe	relations
     between  synonym groups.  grind(1WN) converts the lexicogra-
     pher files	 into  a  database  that  encodes  the	relations
     between the synonym groups.  The different	interfaces to the
     WordNet database use a common library of search routines  to
     display these relations.

     ConText is	an X Windows interface	that  is  used	with  the
     WordNet  lexical  database	 and written texts.  It	is a tool
     for assisting users in hand annotating  English  prose  with
     WordNet sense tags.  ConText is not distributed.

     The Semantic Concordance consists of a group of Brown Corpus
     files  that have been semantically	tagged by hand using Con-
     Text.  Escort, an X  Windows  interface  for  searching  the
     Semantic Concordance, uses	the sense index	and taglist files
     to	find sentences with semantic  tags  to	specific  WordNet
     senses.   The  Semantic  Concordance  and Escort are distri-
     buted.
