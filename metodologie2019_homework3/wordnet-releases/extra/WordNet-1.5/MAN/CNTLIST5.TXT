NAME
     File listing number of times  each	 tagged	 sense	occurs	a
     semantic concordance

DESCRIPTION
     A cntlist file for	a semantic concordance lists  the  number
     of	 times	each  semantic	tag  occurs  in	the concordance's
     files, and	its sense number in the	WordNet	 database.   Each
     line  in the file corresponds to a	unique sense in	the Word-
     Net database to which at  least  one  semantic  tag  points.
     Only  WordNet  senses that	are tagged in the concordance are
     in	cntlist.

     A cntlist file is provided	with the Semantic Concordance for
     informational and statistical purposes only.  It is not used
     by	any software provided with the WordNet or  Semantic  Con-
     cordance  packages.   It is generated by counting the number
     of	location fields	for each sense in the taglist file,  then
     sorting the file in descending numerical order.

     The grind(1WN) program uses a cntlist file	to  assign  sense
     numbers to	senses in the WordNet database based on	frequency
     of	use.  The actual cntlist file used by grind(1WN)  is  not
     the  one provided with the	Semantic Concordance, but a union
     of	several	cntlist	files created by the process  of  tagging
     several  different	 semantic concordances.	 The cntlist file
     used to build the WordNet	database  is  provided	with  the
     WordNet package.

  File Format
     Each line in a  cntlist  file  represents	one  sense.   The
     fields  are separated by one space, and the file is in order
     from most to least	frequently tagged sense.  Sense	tags hav-
     ing  the  same  number  of	occurrences are	listed in reverse
     alphabetical order	of the lemma field of the senseencoding.

     Each line in cntlist is of	the form:

	  count	 senseencoding	 sensenumber

     where count is the	number of times	the sense is  tagged  and
     senseencoding  is	 a  word sense encoded in the sense index
     format described in senseindex(5WN).

     The last field is the decimal integer sense  number  of  the
     sense in WordNet.
