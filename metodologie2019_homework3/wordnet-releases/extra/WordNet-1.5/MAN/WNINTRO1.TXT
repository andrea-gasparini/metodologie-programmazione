DESCRIPTION
     The WordNet interfaces allow the user to search the  WordNet
     database and display the information textually.  Escort pro-
     vides an X	Windows	interface to  the  Semantic  Concordance,
     and  is  only  available  on Unix platforms.  wngrep is also
     available only on Unix platforms.

     The WordNet database is organized into  eight  ASCII  files,
     two  for  each  part  of speech represented in WordNet.  The
     format of the database is described in wndb(5WN).

     The Semantic Concordance consists	of  103	 files	from  the
     Brown  Corpus that	have been annotated by hand with semantic
     tags pointing to senses in	the WordNet database.  The Seman-
     tic Concordance is	described in semcor(7WN).

     All of the	interfaces to the WordNet database use	a  common
     library of	search and morphology code.  See wnintro(3WN) for
     an	overview of the	WordNet	library.

     See wngloss(7WN) for a glossary of	WordNet	terminology and	a
     discussion	 of  the database's content and	logical	organiza-
     tion.
